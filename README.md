# Rekon
## Scout into your riak cluster

### About
Pronounced |ˈrēˌkän; riˈkän| (like recon)

Rekon is a data visualization utility inspired by Briak.  I have been waiting for
riak to release a list buckets feature, which is here in 0.14. 
`http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak?buckets=true`

### To Do:
* Get riak in memory test harness setup.
* Test connection to primary configured riak server
* First run install into datastore
* add http authentication
* editing of per bucket parameters
* setting key content type
* editing links between keys
* syntax highlight json 


### Goals
Provide better visibility into riak nodes individually and as a cluster.
