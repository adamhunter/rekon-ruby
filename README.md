# Rekon
## Scout into your riak cluster

### About

Rekon is a data visualization utility inspired by Briak.  I have been waiting for
riak to release a list buckets feature, which is here in 0.14. 
`http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak?buckets=true`

### To Do:
* Get riak in memory test harness setup.
* Setup sinatra app base
* Setup command line util for booting web server
* Test connection to primary configured riak server
* First run install into datastore
* Allow adding multiple nodes
* Sync Buckets
* List Keys
* Pretty print object
* add http authentication
* allow editing of per bucket parameters

### Goals
Provide better visibly into riak nodes individually and as a cluster.
